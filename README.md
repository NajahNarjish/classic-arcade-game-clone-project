## Introduction

This is a Classic Arcade Game Clone project that I've done as part of my Nanodegree program in Udacity. The project is made using html, css and javascript. The html,css, enjine.js, resource.js, app.js, images were provided by Udacity and I have updated the javascript code by modifying app.js file. I added the player and enemies and made them move and colide.


## How to run

Just clone the project and open the index.html file on a browser. This project is tested on chrome browser. 


## How to play
There are 4 enemies and one player. Enemies are moving in various speeds. Player has to pass through all of them and reach the water. We have to use "left", "right", "up", "down" keys of the keyboard to move the player. If player collides with any of the enemies, then it goes back to its initial positon. Time count starts just after refreshing the page and it stops when the player reaches the water.
